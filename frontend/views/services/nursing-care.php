We focus on providing patients with relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. We work closely with each individual’s medical team to provide an extra layer of support. Palliative care can be for any person, of any age, and at any stage in a serious illness and can be provided along with curative treatment. It focuses on symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, constipation, nausea, loss of appetite, difficulty in sleeping and depression. It also helps you gain the strength to carry on with daily life. It improves your ability to tolerate medical treatments. And it helps you have more control over your care by improving your understanding of your choices for treatment. End of life care is for people at an advanced stage of their illness or disease. They have either chosen not to have any further treatment or they have exhausted all appropriate treatments available to them. With our expertise we are always looking at the bigger picture, so we can constantly assess and respond to any changes in care needs quickly. We know how important it is that you and your loved ones are looked after and supported through this final stage of life. By staying with the client in their own home, our Nurses will:

It affects who we are, the way we think, act, and feel. These changes can be temporary or permanent, and may cause deterioration or a complete inability to perform and function. For many, returning to their previous lifestyle is no longer possible.

Like all of us, they are just trying to cope with the changes and occurrences of daily life as best they can; however, they are now faced with the additional challenges that have come with their injury. If you or a loved one is faced with a longer term disability as a result of a brain or spinal cord injury, you understand the struggles of everyday living.

Caring People’s live-in nurses and medical professionals have the training, education, and expertise to effectively care brain and spinal cord injury patients. We understand the challenges of brain and spinal cord injuries and have the ability to help with activities of daily living and in-home nursing needs to offer the highest level of comfort.
